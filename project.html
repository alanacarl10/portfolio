    This was the creation of an inclusive web page for a group hungry for change. This was a site done within three weeks, yet it still gave me an idea of how to utilize the UX process.  </h4></div>

    <h1>Overview of the project</h1>
    <p>During this time period I was the planning chair for the organization (WoCo) and helped to plan events to boost recruitment and retain members. However, as the most tech comfortable member, when there was a need for a website, I was the one to volunteer. As a new team with an older legacy, and even older website, we needed an updated way to convey our mission to the necessary parties both for general use and for use after our upcoming big events. So, my question was, how to use our newly updated value system to build the foundation of an online presence? </p>

    <h2>Role </h2>
    
    <p>By using the final in a web development class as a way to combine responsibilities, I become a guerrilla team of one: researcher, designer, and developer.</p>
    
    <h2>Duration </h2>
    
    <p>November 30th 2019- December 13, 2019 </p>

    <h1> Challenges</h1>
    <p>Before I could begin, I had to define my constraints and understand what I was looking for.</p>

    <h2>Constraints: </h2>

    <h3>Timing </h3>

    <p>I came up with the idea of combining responsibilities for my class and towards my group. However, this meant that I was trying to get everything done during finals’ week, including seeking feedback from two different groups of busy people. The group (WoCo) also felt it imperative for me to have it done by Spring semester as we had multiple events planned that might get us featured in the news. </p>

    <h3>Technical knowledge </h3>

    <p>Because I opted to do this for a class, I was also fully responsible for coding the website. So, I had to maintain a strict balance for design and technical feasibility. </p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>

    <p>Who is my audience? How do I attempt to combine all of their needs into one site that does justice to everyone's desires? </p>

    <h1> The Solution Process<br>
      Step 1:  Background Research</h1>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2 style= " margin-bottom: -0.5vw;">Pitch</h2>
  <p style="padding-top: 0.6vw;color: black;"> First things first, I needed something to anchor this project. It was most like a problem statement, or a mission statement. It answered a vital question: what was I doing?</p>

 <section><img class= "boo" src="pitch.PNG" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px;"> </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>User Personas</h2>
          <p >After realizing my goal and constraints, I started to work. The first thing I did was make some quick and dirty personas to understand who I was designing for. I had to get out of my own mind as while I was involved in the group, I was not taking on the role of a user. The personas were without any fluff, but they got the job done to get me thinking about what was needed.</p>

    <h1> The questions I had to ask were: 

      <br>Why would they be using this site? How can I make it as simple, but informative to use? </h1>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Inspiration </h2>
      <p>I was dealing with around a three week turnaround deadline. I did not have time to reinvent the wheel. I took materials that the group already paid for from a graphic designer and went looking at other sites that were in the same realm as us.</p>
        
      <p>This saved me time and also helped me pinpoint what I wanted on our website. It was a quick, dirty and easy way to do a competitive analysis. I took inspiration from the sources and started to make my benchmarks. </p>

  </section>
  
  <section>
   <h1> Usability </h1>
 
  <p>>  I had to think of how intuitive it would be to use the website. To do this, I had to understand why certain users would come to the site. Our previous version of the website left a lot to be desired, but I still had to find a way to parse information so that it can be simple, but still informative. </p>
  <p>A student looking for a club will most likely be looking for fun events to go to. They’ll also want to know who we are personally. An administrator would like to see who we are in relation to our standing with other groups. Other campus leaders would like to see what we stand for and if we are compatible with their values. To solve this, I designed a wire frame with only 4 categories and with content that would meet the objectives of the primary user base. </p>

  <section>
   <h1> Accessibility: </h1>
  <p>I thought about this throughout the process rather than at the end. I made sure my site was thoroughly validated by the W3 checker. Another reason to make it simple as simple pages are easier to tab through. I made a style tile for several reasons, one to communicate with my group on which colors looked best, but to also check out the accessibility of my proposed palette using tools such as web-aim. It was also a good way to communicate and check for accessibility in relation to text readability (fun fonts aren’t always the most accessible). </p>

  <section>
   <h1> Inclusivity: </h1>
<p>Did people see themselves reflected in us? To make sure, I used words and images to cultivate a sense of- this is who and what we represent. It was half copy-editing and half design. It was design thinking. </p>

  <h1>Results and Remarks</h1>
<p>Even though "officially" I was done with the bulk of the UX work at this point, I was still utilizing best practices. I used GitHub to store my files and through that, I found a way to I was able to utilize information architecture to store information so that it was readily available. I utilized collaboration with my group members even after the research and design phase to get input. Before I submitted my project, I made sure to get feedback from my professor. It was a loop. Even now, it is not closed, as this is only the foundation.

While real-world constraints limited me, the process through which I was able to get the project through is still one I hope to expand on in further opportunities.
