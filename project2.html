    <h1>Overview </h1> </div>
    <p> My group and I were tasked with the idea of transforming a 3D space and its respective site. The site was housed in the library for Michigan State University. It was a “Café” area that had not been updated as the spaces around it were. The website itself had also not been updated either. Our stakeholders were head librarians.  </p>

    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p> How to make the area enjoyable to us for all use cases and how to make the website useful and seamless?</p>


  
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h1> Challenges</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center">Before I could begin, I had to define my constraints and understand what I was looking for.</p>

    <h2>Constraints: </h2>

    <h3>Timing </h3>

    <p> We only had a set amount of time from start to finish-weeks. So, it was imperative we not only did it quickly, but got it right </p>

    <h3>Physical Space Knowhow </h3>

    <p>A lot of what I knew about user experience and product design basics were based on web, however, now I was being asked to consider such thing such as fabrics for couches. </p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>

    <p>Who is my audience? How many audiences do I have? What audience can be compromised with, and which ones do we need to pay particular attention to? </p>

  <p style="padding-top: 0.6vw;color: black;"> The first thing we did after consulting with the client was simply walking around. We all chose times based on client background information. This allowed us to schedule for times that represented a “shift” in the cafe area.

 <p>After doing an observational study, it was clear there were issues with the way both the website and site were designed. It had to be multifunctional enough to meet the needs of three different populations, however in trying to do so, it was only marginally meeting the needs of each population. For example, in trying to have computers accessible, it was interfering with other people in accessing precious outlet space. Another example is the amount of tables as it doubled for eating areas, but also made it difficult to get around in the area making for frustration if one had to use the restroom or get food from the nearby convenience store. 
</p>

  <section style="border-bottom:3px solid black; border-top:3px solid black">
    <div class="boxed"><h2> I needed to answer: 

      <br>What are some of the low hanging things that could be remedied, such as adding more tables? What are some more difficult things, such as changing the layout of the nearby convivence store? What is needed versus what is just a nice to have? </h2> </div>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>User Interviews </h2>
      <p>The next thing to do was to ask questions. Everyone took a shift and asked the same questions at different times of the day to get a more natural pool of people.</p>

      <p>We were able to verify and update our assumptions about the space using the findings.  </p>

    <h2>Personas </h2>
      <p>We then used personas to get an idea of who was saying what. We already knew that some populations were more numerous than others, and due to that, some populations might have had to compromise a bit more.

      <section><img class= "boo" src="pers2.png" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px;" alt ="persona. Goals: 
        • To get to class on time • To have a quick bite between studying and going to class • Be as non-distracted as possible with surrounding environment. 
        Frustrations: 
        • Lines are sometimes long for the food • Little room to plug in laptops and other things • Not enough good seating in terms of comfortability and space-wise

  <img class="boo" src="vis.png" alt="Style tile.">
  <p class ="caption">A style tile designed by one of my teammates. We were constrained in using colors associated with the brand for MSU, however, we were pretty open in which shades we could use. By combining the findings from the surveys and personas, we were able to get a sense of what users came to the space to do and how they wanted to feel. This really influenced the final design. 
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <img class="boo" src="furn.PNG" alt="images of couches and tables.">
  <p class ="caption">  Here is an example of some of the furniture chosen. The furniture chosen was a mix of stylish and functional. For example, the high back chair was chosen to support people for a long time when they wanted to sit near the bar area by the windows. The couch was chosen to be of a more “natural” and comfortable area for either groups (the middle could be lifted) or for individuals.  

  </p>
</section>

<section style="border-bottom:2px solid gray">
  <div class="boxed"><h1>Results and Remarks</h1> </div>
 <p> While UX can be mostly seen in the digital world, a lot of the concepts can still be applied regardless of medium. This project I was able to go out of my comfort zone and work in a group and play on each of our abilities. By doing the project start to finish, it was really an exercise in design thinking.
